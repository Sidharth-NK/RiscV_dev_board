# HiFive1 Rev B Development Board Repository

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for working with the **HiFive1 Rev B** development board, which is based on the **SiFive FE310-G002** RISC-V processor. The HiFive1 Rev B is designed for developing and testing RISC-V applications, especially for embedded system projects.

This repository includes examples and libraries for basic functionality like **LED blinking**, **UART communication**, and **sensor interfacing** using various communication protocols like **SPI** and **I2C**. It also includes instruction for wifi connectivity using the esp32 SOLO-1 module in the board                            . It also includes configurations and setup instructions for working with the **Freedom SDK**, **Freedom Metal**, and **PlatformIO**.
